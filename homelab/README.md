# üè†üß™ Homelab

This is where all the Infrastructure as Code (IaC) for my Homelab lives.

## Overview

*   Kubernetes Cluster (k3s)
*   3D Printer Server

### Hardware

*   Raspberry Pi 4

### Naming Convention

I use the following convention to name my servers:

*   Platform
    *   `HLB` = Homelab
    *   `AWS` = Amazon Web Services
    *   `GCP` = Google Cloud Platform
    *   `MAZ` = Microsoft Azure
*   Compute Type
    *   `P` = Physical machine
    *   `V` = Virtual machine
*   Configuration
    *   `S` = Standalone
    *   `C` = Cluster
*   Environment
    *   `D` = Development
    *   `T` = Test
    *   `P` = Production
*   Sequential ID
    *   `NNN` = (ex: `001`, `002`, ... `100`)

#### Examples

*   `HLB-PSD-001` - A **homelab**-hosted (`HLB`) **physical** machine (`P`) in a **standalone** (`S`) configuration used
    for **development** (`D`) environment workloads.

*   `AWS-VCP-666` - An **AWS**-hosted (`AWS`) **virtual** machine (`V`) in a **cluster** (`C`) configuration used for
    **production** (`P`) environment workloads.

### ü•ß Raspberry Pi Systems

I have several Raspberry Pis deployed throughout my Homelab running a variety of workloads. In order to simplify the
management of these systems, I use the same operating system installed using the same imager software and settings
whenever possible. This provides a reliable/repeatable baseline by which I can provision the systems with Ansible.

### Current Software Used

*   [Ubuntu Server 22.04 LTS (Jammy Jellyfish)](https://releases.ubuntu.com/jammy/)
*   [Raspberry Pi Imager](https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/)

### Setup

1.  Flash latest Ubuntu LTS (64bit) ARM-based image onto sd card - 16GiB or larger. Use the
    [Raspberry Pi Imager](https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/). Choose the following options.
    1.  Set hostname: `<hostname>.local`
    2.  Enable SSH: `Allow public-key authentication only`
        1.  Set authorization for: `<contents_of_public_key_file>`
    3.  Set username and password:
        1.  Username: `<username>`
        2.  Password: `<password>`
    4.  Configure wireless LAN _(only if necessary)_:
        1.  SSID: `<Wifi Name>`
            1.  Hidden SSID: `true`
        2.  Password: `<Wifi Password>`
    5.  Set locale settings:
        1.  Timezone: `America/Los_Angeles`
        2.  Keyboard layout: `us`
    6.  Eject Media when Finished
    7.  Enable Telemetry
2.  Insert newly flashed drive into the raspberry pi and power on. Give it 1-2 minutes to boot.
3.  Test SSH connection: `ssh <username>@<hostname>`

## üîß Tooling

*   [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com/) - a radically simple IT automation platform that makes your applications and
    systems easier to deploy and maintain.
*   [Secrets OPerationS (SOPS)](https://github.com/mozilla/sops) - Simple and flexible tool for managing secrets.
*   [age](https://github.com/FiloSottile/age) - A simple, modern and secure encryption tool (and Go library) with small
    explicit keys, no config options, and UNIX-style composability.

## Ansible

### Useful commands

*   Encrypt a secrets file called `secrets.sops.yml`

    ```sh
    sops \
        --encrypt \
        --age <age-key> \
        --encrypted-regex '^(cf_api_token|cf_zone_id)$' \
        --in-place secrets.sops.yml
    ```

*   Decrypt a secrets file called `secrets.sops.yml`

    ```sh
    sops \
        --decrypt \
        --age <age-key> \
        --encrypted-regex '^(cf_api_token|cf_zone_id)$' \
        --in-place secrets.sops.yml
    ```
