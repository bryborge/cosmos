## 🚀 About the Project

**Cosmos** is a monorepo where I define and manage infrastructure in my homelab and on various cloud provider platforms,
adhering to Infrastructure as Code (IaC) principles where possible.

### 🧬 Structure

This project is subdivided by cloud provider platform.  Each platform contains documentation specific to what tools are
used to manage it, and how to use them.

### 📖 Definitions

*   IT Infrastructure

    > _Information technology (IT) infrastructure are the components required to operate and manage enterprise IT
    > environments. IT infrastructure can be deployed within a cloud computing system, or within an organization's own
    > facilities._
    >
    > -- Red Hat ([Source article](https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/cloud-computing/what-is-it-infrastructure))

*   Infrastructure as Code

    With that understanding of IT Infrastructure, we can describe Infrastructure as Code (IaC) in the following way.

    > _Infrastructure as Code (IaC) is the managing and provisioning of infrastructure through code instead of through
    > manual processes._
