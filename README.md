## üöÄ About the Project

**Cosmos** is a monorepo where I define and manage infrastructure in my homelab and on various cloud provider platforms,
adhering to infrastructure-as-code principles where possible.

### üìñ Definitions

*   IT Infrastructure

    > _Information technology (IT) infrastructure are the components required to operate and manage enterprise IT
    > environments. IT infrastructure can be deployed within a cloud computing system, or within an organization's own
    > facilities._
    >
    > -- Red Hat ([Source article](https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/cloud-computing/what-is-it-infrastructure))

*   Infrastructure (as Code)

    With that understanding of IT Infrastructure, we can describe Infrastructure as Code (IaC) in the following way.

    > _Infrastructure as Code (IaC) is the managing and provisioning of infrastructure through code instead of through
    > manual processes._
    >
    > -- Red Hat ([Source article](https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/automation/what-is-infrastructure-as-code-iac))

## üîß Tooling

*   [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) - IaC tool for building, changing, and versioning infrastructure safely
    and efficiently.
*   [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com/) - A radically simple IT automation platform that makes your applications and
    systems easier to deploy and maintain.
*   [Secrets OPerationS (SOPS)](https://github.com/mozilla/sops) - Simple and flexible tool for managing secrets.
*   [age](https://github.com/FiloSottile/age) - A simple, modern and secure encryption tool (and Go library) with small
    explicit keys, no config options, and UNIX-style composability.
