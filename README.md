## About the Project

Cosmos is a mono-repo where I define and manage infrastructure in my homelab, and on various cloud provider platforms,
adhering to infrastructure-as-code principles where possible.

### Tools

*   [Packer](https://www.packer.io/) - Identical machine images for multiple platforms from a single source 
    configuration.
*   [Cloud Init](https://cloudinit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) - Industry standard multi-distribution method for
    cross-platform cloud instance initialization.
*   [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com/) - IT automation platform that makes applications and systems easier to deploy
    and maintain.
*   [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) - IaC tool for building, changing, and versioning infrastructure safely
    and efficiently.
    *   [Terragrunt](https://terragrunt.gruntwork.io/) - (coming soon ...)
*   [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/) - A tool for building and distributing development environments.
