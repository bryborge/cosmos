## üöÄ About the Project

**Cosmos** is a monorepo where I define and manage infrastructure in my homelab and on various cloud provider platforms,
adhering to Infrastructure as Code (IaC) principles where possible.

### üß¨ Structure

This project is subdivided by cloud provider platform.  Each platform contains documentation specific to what tools are
used to manage it, and how to use them.

### üîê SecOps

IT security and strategies for handling secrets is an entire discipline to itself. After much deliberation and weighing tradeoffs, I settled on using [SOPS (Standard Operating ProcedureS)](https://github.com/getsops/sops) and [Age](https://github.com/FiloSottile/age) for encryption of sensitive information that will be committed to version control.

#### What is SOPS?

A simple and flexible tool for managing secrets.

#### What is Age?

Pronounced (`aghe` with a "hard" `g`), it's a simple, modern and secure encryption tool with small explicit keys, no config options, and UNIX-style composability.

#### Tradeoffs

| Pros | Cons |
|------|------|
| Ease of intergration (in the future) with other key management services | Operational overhead |
| File format agnostic | Key management complexity |
| It's free üí∞ |  |
|  |  |

#### General Thoughts

This, by itself, is **NOT** comprehensive, but is "adequate enough" for me. None of the workloads, systems, or processes managed here are life-or-death.  This project is, in large part, centered around learning and tinkering.  That said, I have taken time to consider what security means to me and my IT infrastructure, and implore you to do the same.

## üîß Tooling

*   [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com/) - a radically simple IT automation platform that makes your applications and
    systems easier to deploy and maintain.
*   [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) - Infrastructure automation to provision and manage resources in any cloud or data center.
*   [Secrets OPerationS (SOPS)](https://github.com/mozilla/sops) - Simple and flexible tool for managing secrets.
*   [Age](https://github.com/FiloSottile/age) - A simple, modern and secure encryption tool (and Go library) with small
    explicit keys, no config options, and UNIX-style composability.

## üî§ Naming Convention

I use the following convention to name my compute where possible:

*   **Platform**

    Describes "where" the compute lives.

    | Code  | Description             |
    |-------|-------------------------|
    | `HLB` | Homelab                 |
    | `AWS` | Amazon Web Services     |
    | `GCP` | Google Cloud Platform   |
    | `MAZ` | Microsoft Azure         |

*   **Compute Type**

    Describes the "material" composition of the compute unit.

    | Code | Description       |
    |------|-------------------|
    | `P`  | Physical machine  |
    | `V`  | Virtual machine   |

*   **Configuration**

    Describes the "relationship" of the compute unit to other units.

    | Code | Description  |
    |------|--------------|
    | `S`  | Standalone   |
    | `C`  | Cluster      |

*   **Environment**

    Describes the environment "volatility" that the compute unit resides in. (e.g., development is highly volatile, test is less volatile but still not guaranteed to be fully operational, and production is reliable/available).

    | Code | Description   |
    |------|---------------|
    | `D`  | Development   |
    | `T`  | Test          |
    | `P`  | Production    |

*   **Numeric ID**

    Provides a "unique" numeric identifier (most useful for identifying units of compute in a large cluster configuration).

    | Code  | Description                           |
    |-------|---------------------------------------|
    | `NNN` | (ex: `001`, `002`, ... `100`)         |

### Examples

*   `HLB-PSD-001` - A **homelab**-hosted (`HLB`) **physical** machine (`P`) in a **standalone** (`S`) configuration used
    for **development** (`D`) environment workloads.

*   `AWS-VCP-666` - An **AWS**-hosted (`AWS`) **virtual** machine (`V`) in a **cluster** (`C`) configuration used for
    **production** (`P`) environment workloads.
